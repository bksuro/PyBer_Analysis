# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
Analyze all the rideshare data from January to early May of 2019 and create a compelling visualization(s) for the CEO of PyBer. Analytical work involved in this project should be comprehensive and correct.


## Resources
- Data Source: city_data.csv, ride_data.csv
- Software: anaconda3, python 3.7.7, jupyter notebook


## Results

Raw data is plotted using bubble graph to get a visual idea of the data.

## Summary

## Challenge Overview

V. Isualize has given you and Omar a brand-new assignment. Using your Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, you’ll create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, you’ll create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, you’ll submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.
